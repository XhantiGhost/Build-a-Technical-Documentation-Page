# Build-a-Technical-Documentation-Page
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL.  Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.  You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS.
